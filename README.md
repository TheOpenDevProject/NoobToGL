# NoobToGL
Just some Modern OpenGL walk throughs

This repo is a simple Hello OpenGL for the Modern OpenGL programmer and does nothing more than display a triangle (See below).

It relies on GLFW3 for its window system but provides a safety wrapper around it that makes it more C++11ish.

I may in time add things like particle effects.
